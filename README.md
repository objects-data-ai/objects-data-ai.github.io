This book is about uncovering a journey of how Software programming evolved and AI based technologies came into foray. This book tries to connect the dots for a new programmer, starting on his/her journey into the software development world. With so many technologies evolving around every single day, with new breaches in innovation in the field of AI/ML or Data Science, which gets the job done in a whisker, as programmers we tend to think, where do we stand? The journey or even the thought of making sense of everything around us can be quite overwhelming. From the days of C/C++ programming to Java/C#/JavaScript and Python/MATLAB/R, programming has exponentially evolved. And so, does the computational ability of computers, which also helped in faster execution of these programs, but also to extraction of Information from the data generated via the applications developed by these programs. In this digital age, everything seems to be connected and yet we sweat making sense of all these connections. 
In the interconnected digital age, understanding the connections between various technologies can be challenging. The book aims to bridge some of these gaps by providing readers with a foundational understanding of how programming, data, and machine learning are interconnected. By grasping these fundamentals, software developers can connect the dots according to their specific requirements.
